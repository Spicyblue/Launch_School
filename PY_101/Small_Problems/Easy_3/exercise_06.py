# Madlibs
# Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words.
# You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, 
# creating an often silly or funny story as a result.
# Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, 
# an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.
# Example
# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly
# Expected output
# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
# The blue dog walks quickly over the lazy dog.
# The dog quickly walks up to Joe's blue turtle.

# Solution 

noun = input("Enter a noun: ")
verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
adjective = input("Enter an adjective: ")
adverb = input("Enter an adverb: ")

print(f"""
Do you {verb} your {adjective} {noun} quickly? That's hilarious!
The {adjective} {noun} {verb}s {adverb} over the lazy {noun}.
The {noun} {adverb} {verb}s up to Joe's {adjective} turtle.
