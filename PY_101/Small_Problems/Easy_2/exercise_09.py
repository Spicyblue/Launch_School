# How Old is Teddy?
# Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. 
# To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 100, inclusive.
#Further Exploration
# Modify this program to ask for a name, then print the age for that person. 
# For an extra challenge, use "Teddy" as the name if no name is entered.

# Solution
