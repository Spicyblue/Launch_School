# Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, 
# then asks whether the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all 
# numbers between 1 and the entered integer, inclusive.
# Further Exploration
# Suppose the input was a list of space separated integers instead of just a single integer? 
# How would your compute_sum and compute_product functions change?
