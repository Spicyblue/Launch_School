# What will the following two lines of code output?

print(0.3 + 0.6)
print(0.3 + 0.6 == 0.9)

#  the first print function return 0.8999. Most floating point representations used on computers lack a certain amount of precision
#  the second will return a boolean false because comparing floats can sometimes lead to misleading results.
