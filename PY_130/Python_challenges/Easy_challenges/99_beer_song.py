See the test suite for the entire song.

# Solution
'''
PEDAC
Problem:
    Input: Integer
    output: String

    Exp: 
    - Valid digits are integers above 0.
    - Alwasy starts from the integer input and down.

    imp:
    - unittest test cases show that our we need a BeerSong class 
      which doesnt accept any argument passed to its constructor.
    - The class should have a verse classmethod to which takes in one argument
      and return the verse of the beersong.
    - The class should have a verses classmethod to which takes in two argument
      and return the verse of the beersong.
    - The class should have a lyrics classmethod to which takes no argument 
      and the whole verses of the beersong.
 
Examples:
Using unittest TestCase

Data Structure:
Class with class variables and methods.

Algorithm:
    Highend
    - Get the verse required.
    - Construct the verse.
    - Return the verse

    Lowend:
        - Define a class method verse:
        - Accept parameter start_verse
        - Call _get_verse with start_verse and return the result

        - Define a class method verses:
        - Accept parameters start_verse and end_verse
        - Call _get_verse with start_verse and end_verse, return the result

        - Define a class method lyrics:
        - Call _get_verse with 99 and 0, return the result

        - Define a static method _get_verse:
        - Accept parameters start_verse and end_verse (default to None)
        - Set _start_verse to start_verse
        - Set _end_verse to end_verse if provided, otherwise to _start_verse
        - Define verse_0 and verse_1 as default verses
        - Initialize requested_verse as an empty string
        - Iterate from _start_verse down to _end_verse (inclusive):
            - If verse is 0, add verse_0 to requested_verse
            - If verse is 1, add verse_1 to requested_verse
            - Otherwise, add a dynamically generated verse to requested_verse
            - Add a newline character between verses (except for the last one)
        - Return requested_verse
