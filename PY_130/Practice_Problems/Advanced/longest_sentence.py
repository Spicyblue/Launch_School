Longest Sentence.
Write a program that prints the longest sentence in a string based on the number of words.
Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?).
You should treat any sequence of characters that are not spaces
or sentence-ending characters as a word.
Thus, -- should count as a word. Log the longest sentence and its word count.
Pay attention to the expected output, and be sure you preserve the punctuation from the end of the sentence.
Note that this problem is about manipulating and processing strings.
As such, every detail about the string matters (e.g., case, punctuation, tabs, spaces, etc.).

problem:
    Exp: 
    - Prints the longest sentence in a string based on the number of words
    - Sentences may end with periods (.), exclamation points (!), or question marks (?).
    - Words are sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending characters.
    - Any sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending characters as a word.
    - Double spaced characters should count as a word.
    - Log the longest sentence and its word count.
    - Preserve the punctuation from the end of the sentence.
    
    Imp:
    - Do not alter the original string.
    - Keep all formats together.

Examples:
See test cases

Data Structure:
list

Algorithm:
    High end.
    1. Go over the whole input string.
    2. Get the longest sentences available in the string.
    3. Verify it is the longest sentence based on word count, not string lenght.
    4. Return the longest sentence and its word count.

    Short end:
    - Get input.
    - Set a max_sentence variable to store longest sentence.
    - Set an initial_sentence variable to store checked sentence.
    - set a max_sentence_counter to store the lenght of the longest string
    - Iterate through the string:
        - Check if the character starts with a space (for new sentences).
            - If yes, pass.
        - Increment inital_sentence by characters.
        - Check if the current character is a sentence ender (.!?)
        - if yes,
            - Strip all trailing and leading spaces and split the inital_sentence into seperated words and save in a variable called initial_word_count.
            - Check if the lenght of the initial_word_count is greater or equall to max_word_count.
            - if yes:
                - join the list of words in initial_word_count with spaces and set to inital_sentence.
                - Set max_sentence to inital_sentence.
                - Set max_word_count to the initial_word_count.
                - reset inital_sentence to '' (an empty string).
        - reset inital_sentence to '' (an empty string).
    - Return the max_sentence and max_word_count based on the test outputs.

## LS Solution ##
# import re

# def longest_sentence(text):
#     sentences = re.findall(r'\w.*?[.!?]', text)

#     longest = max(sentences, key=lambda s: len(s.split()))

#     print(longest + "\n")
#     print(f"The longest sentence has {len(longest.split())} words.\n")

# The chief point of interest in this solution is this statement:
# sentences = re.findall(r'\w.*?[.!?]', text)
# We take advantage of the findall function from the re module.
# The solution leverages the lazy quantifier (*?) to restrict the match to the shortest possible string: a single sentence. Given the pattern, a match:

# \w - starts with any word character
# .*? - may contain any number of characters in the middle (even zero characters)
# [.!?] - ends when the first ., !, or ? after the starting word character is reached
