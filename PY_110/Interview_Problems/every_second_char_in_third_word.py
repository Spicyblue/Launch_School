'''
Every second letter.
Create a function that takes a string argument and 
returns a copy of the string with every second character in every third word converted to uppercase.
Other characters should remain the same.

# Problem
- Input: 
String
- Output:
String

- Rules
    Explicit:
    - Returns a copy of the string with every second character in every third word converted to uppercase
    - Other characters should remain the same.

    Implicit:

# Examples
original = 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing world'
expected = 'Lorem Ipsum iS simply dummy tExT of the pRiNtInG world'
print(to_weird_case(original) == expected)

original = 'It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted'
expected = 'It is a long established fAcT that a rEaDeR will be dIsTrAcTeD'
print(to_weird_case(original) == expected)

print(to_weird_case('aaA bB c') == 'aaA bB c')

original = "Mary Poppins' favorite word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
expected = "Mary Poppins' fAvOrItE word is sUpErCaLiFrAgIlIsTiCeXpIaLiDoCiOuS"
print(to_weird_case(original) == expected)

# Data structure
List

# Algorithm:
    High Level:
    1. Make list of every word in the sentence.
    2. Get every third word in list.
    3. Make every second letter captial in the third word.
    4. Add the changes to the list.
    5. Get back the new sentence.

    Low level:
        1. Get input.
        2. Split string input into list.
        3. Iterate through the list.
            - Check if the current item is the 3rd position (2nd index) in the list:
            - If yes, create an empty string to store the new wierd words:
                - Interate through the elements in the list:
                - Check if the index is odd:
                    - If yes, convert to uppercase and add to string:
                    - Else, just add the letter.
                - Use the new string to reassigned the current element in the list
                - Repeat until the last element in the list.
        4. Join the list with space and return it.
