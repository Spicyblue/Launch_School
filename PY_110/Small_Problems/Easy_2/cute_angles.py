Cute Angles.
Write a function that takes a floating point number representing
an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a string
representing that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds.
You should use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees,
a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds.
There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.
Note: You can use the following constant to represent the degree symbol:

Further Exploration
Our solution only works with positive numbers in the range of 0 to 360 (inclusive). 
Can you refactor it so that it works with any positive or negative number?

DEGREE = "\u00B0"

# Problem
- Input: 
floating point number
- Output:
string representing that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds.

- Rules
    Explicit:
    Use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees.
    Use a single quote to represent minutes.
    Use a double quote to represnt seconds.
    There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.

# Examples
# All of these examples should print True
print(dms(30) == "30°00'00\"")
print(dms(76.73) == "76°43'48\"")
print(dms(254.6) == "254°35'59\"")
print(dms(93.034773) == "93°02'05\"")
print(dms(0) == "0°00'00\"")
print(dms(360) == "360°00'00\"" or dms(360) == "0°00'00\"")

# Algorithm
    - High End 
        1. Get input.
        2. Create a variable for degree, minutes and seconds.
        3. Get the degree value by using int function on the input.
        4. Get minute value by using modulo divsion by 1 on the float of the input.
            - multiply by 60.
        5. Get minute value by using modulo divsion by 1 on the float of minutes.
            - multiply by 60.
        6. Use f string to return result with the right formats.

# DEGREE = "\u00B0"
# MINUTES_PER_DEGREE = 60
# SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60
# SECONDS_PER_DEGREE = MINUTES_PER_DEGREE * SECONDS_PER_MINUTE
