-- 1. Create a Table
-- Now that we have an animals database, we can lay the groundwork needed to add some data to it.

-- Make a table called birds. It should have the following fields:

-- id (a primary key)
-- name (string with space for up to 25 characters)
-- age (integer)
-- species (a string with room for no more than 15 characters)

-- 2. Insert Data
-- For this exercise, we'll add some data to our birds table. Add five records to this database so that our data looks like:


-- id |   name   | age | species
----+----------+-----+---------
--  1 | Charlie  |   3 | Finch
--  2 | Allie    |   5 | Owl
--  3 | Jennifer |   3 | Magpie
--  4 | Jamie    |   4 | Owl
--  5 | Roy      |   8 | Crow

-- 3. Select Data
-- Write an SQL statement to query all data that is currently in our birds table.

-- 4. WHERE Clause
-- In this exercise, let's practice filtering the data we want to query. 
-- Using a WHERE clause, SELECT records for birds under the age of 5.

-- 5. Update Data
-- It seems there was a mistake when we were inserting data in the birds table. 
-- All the crows are actually ravens. 
-- Update the birds table so that the rows with a species of 'Crow' now read 'Raven'.
