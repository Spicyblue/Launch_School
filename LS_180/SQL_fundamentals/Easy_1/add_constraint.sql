-- Add Constraint
-- When we initially created our birds table, 
-- we forgot to take into account a key factor: preventing certain values from being entered into the database.
-- For instance, we would never find a bird that is negative n years old. 
-- We could have included a constraint to ensure that bad data isn't entered for a database record,
-- but we forgot to do so.

-- For this exercise, write some code that ensures that only birds with a positive age may be added to the database. 
-- Then write and execute an SQL statement to check that this new constraint works correctly.

-- Solution

ALTER TABLE birds 
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_age CHECK (age > 0);
