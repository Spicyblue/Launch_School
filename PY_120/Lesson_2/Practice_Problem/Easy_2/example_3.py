What are the benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python?
 Think of as many as you can.

# Solution

# There's no single right answer here, and we certainly can't list all the benefits.
# We will just summarize some of the major ones:
# 1. As software becomes more complex, OOP helps manage this complexity.
# 2. It lets programmers create containers for data that can be changed and manipulated
#    without affecting the entire program.
# 3. It lets programmers section off areas of code that perform specific procedures. 
#    This allows their programs to become the interaction of many small parts 
#    as opposed to a massive blob of dependencies.
# 4. We can talk about objects as nouns and their behaviors as verbs. 
#    These distincitions make it easier to conceptualize the structure of an OO program.
# 5. Creating classes and objects lets programmers think about code at a more abstract level.
# 6. It lets programmers write code that can be used with different kinds of data.
# 7. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
